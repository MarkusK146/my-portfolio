<h2>Hi, I'm Markus Kapferer,</h2>
<p>originating from the scenic southern areas of Bavaria, 
  in close proximity to the Austrian border. I'm currently living in Nuremberg, together with my wife.
  Armed with a bachelor's degree in computer science, I have a background as a Senior UX/UI Designer, 
  leading a dynamic team in crafting seamless user experiences. 
  My role involved guiding product managers through UX research and spearheading 
  the design and usability aspects of new features across both product lines.</p>

<p>Driven by a passion for contributing to the greater good, 
  I'm currently especially interested in designing solutions that benefit humanity. 
  Prior to my UI journey, I dabbled in video projects, creating compelling content for various clients, 
  internal communications, and marketing materials showcasing innovative software products.</p>

<p>Away from computer screens and coding, you'll catch me jamming on my guitar or play console games. 
  I'm a total tech geek, fascinated by things like electric cars, renewable energy, cool gadgets, and the newest devices. 
  I've been into web development since I was 9, 
  and I'm all about staying ahead in the world of innovation. 
  Come along as I blend creativity, tech, and a passion for making a positive impact on the world.</p>
